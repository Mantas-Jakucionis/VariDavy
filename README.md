[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/646774922.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/646774922)

A numerical package for simulating dynamics and spectroscopic signals of the system-bath model using the time-dependent variational method with Davydov D2 and multi-Davydov D2 trial wavefunctions. The package is implemented in the Julia (v1.8.5) programming language.

The package was developed between 2019 and 2023 as part of a PhD study for the dissertation titled "Relaxation theory of quantum systems with feedback: development of methods based on principle of time-dependent variations" (to be defended).

It can simulate excitation dynamics, absorption, fluorescence, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) and other Feynman diagrams of system-bath models.

Included in the package are few example files that demonstrate the syntax for launching simulations. All available input parameters of the system-bath model are provided and annotated in Input.jl file.
