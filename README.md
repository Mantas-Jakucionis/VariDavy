[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/646774922.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/646774922)

Package for simulating system-bath model dynamics and spectra using the time-dependent variational method with Davydov D2 and multi-Davydov D2 trial wavefunctions. It utilizes Julia (v1.8.5) programming language.

The package was written between 2019 and 2023 as part of PhD studies for dissertation "Relaxation theory of quantum systems with feedback: development of methods based on principle of time-dependent variations".

It can simulate excitation dynamics, absorption, fluorescence, 2DES and other Feynman diagram signals of molecular aggregates. 

Included are few example files that demonstrate syntax of launching simulations. All available input parameters of the system-bath model are presented and annotated in Input.jl
